1. Binary search tree: A binary search tree (BST), also known as an ordered binary tree, is a node-based data structure in which each node has no more than two child nodes. Each child must either be a leaf node or the root of another binary search tree.

2. Hash tables Hash: Table is a data structure which stores data in an associative manner. In a hash table, data is stored in an array format, where each data value has its own unique index value.

3. Linked lists: an ordered set of data elements, each containing a link to its successor 

4. Queue: One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data (dequeue). Queue follows First-In-First-Out methodology..

5. Stack:  a structure where insertion and deletion of items takes place at one end called top of the stack.

6. Merge sort: it is a divide and conquer algorithm and it divides the array until atomicity is achived. once atomicity is achived they are joined back in the same order but are sorted before merging.

7. Insertion sort: It it the most basic type of sorting. it compares all the values.

8. Bubble sort: Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order

9. Dynamic programming: breaking big problem into smaller problems and then solving them.

10. Greedy algorithm: It wrks in such a way that the cmputer selects the best option as per the input and the data available for the best optiumum results.
the problem described here is the simple coin change problem which computes the minimum amount of coins required for the given amount.
