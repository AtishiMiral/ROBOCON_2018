//Linked List
/*
They can be implemented using pointers and structures consisting of a data element and one address element
The address element of one node points to data eleement of the next
Insertion and deletion is easier in linked lists than array
*/


//Stacks
/*
They are are a pile of data elements stacked upon on another
The elements are accessed by a stack pointer
It works of LIFO principle i.e the most recently added data is removed first
*/

//Queue

//Just like a stack but has FIFO prnciple(first in first out)
//Is accessed by two pointers rear and front, one for inserting element and othe for removing


//Hash
