1. ARRAY - An array is a series of elements of the same type placed in continuous memory locations that can be individually referenced by adding an index to a unique identifier.
   In this code 5 numbers are inserted in the array and their sum is calculated.
2. BINARY TREE - Unlike Arrays, Linked Lists, Stack and queues, which are linear data structures, trees are hierarchical data structures.
   The topmost node is called root of the tree. The elements that are directly under an element are called its children.
   In this code we are giving different values to the left and right branch of the tree.
3. LINKED LIST - A linked list is a linear collection of data elements, called nodes pointing to the next nodes by means of pointers.
   this code includes insertion and deletion of elements from linked lists.
4. QUEUE - Logically a queue is a FIFO(first in first out) structure and physically it can be implemented either as an array or as a linked lists.
   Code includes two functions one is for insertion and other is for deletion of elements from queue.
5. STACK - A stack is a LIFO(last in first out) structure and physically it can be implemented as an array or linked list like queue.
   This code has two function one for push(insertion of element in stack) operation and other for pop(deletion of elements in stack) operation.
