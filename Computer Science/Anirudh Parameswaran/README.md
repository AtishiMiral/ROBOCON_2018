****Data Structures****

1.	__*Double Stack:*__
The given code is for a double stack. It has two separate stacks that are assigned the same array. The sum of maximum elements  in both the stacks equals the size of the array. Insertion and deletion in both the arrays can be implemented independently.

2.	__*Binary Tree:*__
The given is the code for a binary search tree. It supports insertion at the designated place, deletion from tree, destruction of tree and searching for an element.

3.	__*Queue:*__
The given code is for a standard queue that supports FIFO strategy and has function for insertion, deletion and for searching.

4.	__*Red-Black Tree:*__
The given code is for a standard Red-Black tree that supports Insertion, Deletion and calculating the depth of the tree.

5. __*Merge Sort:*__
The given code is for merge sorting an array of integers. It follows Divide and Conquer algorithm.

6. __*Insertion Sort:*__
The given code is for Insertion sorting an array of integers. It uses a sentinel to assign the value of the smallest number to thefirst position in the array before sorting it.
